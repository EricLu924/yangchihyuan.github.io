#### Abstract
In this talk, I will summarize my research on stocking investing for the overall 4.5 years. I started my study from asking a question I could not answer. Why are there a few people making a lot of money from the stock market, like Warren Buffet? To satisfy my curiosity, I seek answers from reading books. However, there are many books in the library offering incorrect answers. The story is not so simple, and one question follows another one. In addition to Warren Buffet, who are the other winners in the stock market? Do they use the same method? How do they think and make decisions? Is it possible to copy their method in todayâ€™s Taiwan? To answer those questions, I read as many books as possible to collect data any analyze gathered information. Such an activity is like doing a historical and literature study, which takes time but is interesting to me. After reading more than 190 books and many other materials, I felt that I reach the answer. I can clearly answer why Warren Buffet and his friends are so rich.
