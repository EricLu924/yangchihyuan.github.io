We invite faculty, researchers and students in Taiwan to submit posters for presentation at the TAAI AI Forum. The poster session will showcase recent advances in both foundational and applied Artificial Intelligence (AI). The forum is intended to create awareness of the breadth of ongoing AI research efforts in Taiwan and create new synergies at the intersection of various disciplines both within acamedic communities and with external stakeholders. The intended audience for the poster session includes program officers from funding agencies, industry representatives, and academic researchers from a variety of disciplines.

Posters can highlight research work published in other peer-reviewed forums with appropriate acknowledgments. 

All posters should have a distinct AI element. Topics that align with Five Plus Two Industry Innovation Plan are encouraged. Topics of interest include, but not limited to the following:

1. Foundational advances in design of AI models, algorithms and theory and their software and hardware implementations.
2. AI for accelerating scientific progress in all disciplines including AI-driven discovery and optimization.
3. Social, psychological and ethical aspects of AI, including human-machine interaction. 

Topics related to AI education should have a research aspect for it to be eligible for this session.
