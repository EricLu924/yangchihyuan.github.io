title: "Survey of Intelligent Technologies 2024"
---

Fall 2024, Friday. 9:10am to 12:00pm, Classroom: BTD <br/>
Instructors: Lun-Wei Ku, Yu-Chung Wang, and Chih-Yuan Yang

#### Course Information

In this course, we will introduce three fundamental topics in artificial intelligent computer vision: deep learning (DL), natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision (CV). We expect students to get the concepts of the three fields through our lectures if they are experts in other academic fields but have little background training experience in AI. Each of DL, NLP, and CV will be lectured in five to six weeks, and the overall grade of this course is averaged by a student's performance in the three divisions.

#### Prerequisites

- Sufficient ability in English listening, speaking, reading, and writing. 
- Experience in programming languages, particularly Python, the widely used language for intelligent computation. 
- Knowledge of college-level mathematics.
