- Companion-robot helper for nurses in a pediatric ICU
![PICU Scenario](http://yangchihyuan.github.io/assets/img/PICU_Scenario_1.jpg)
This is a project for developing a companion robot to help nurses in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). There is a shortage of nurses in Taiwan, due to several factors such as low salaries, unsatisfying working environment, and the reduction of young working labors in the population structure caused by sub-replacement fertility. In a PICU, children have to be separated from their parents for most time due to the sanity issue. In contrast, a companion robot can be totally sanitized and stay in the PICU. In practice, a PICU nurse usually needs to take care of multiple wards to make the operation economic. When a nurse is busy for one ward, she/he needs a helper to look after other wards. Currently such a duty is delegated to a nurse colleague, so there are multiple nurses on duty in a PICU.

For intraocular microsurgery, robotic assistance is a cutting-edge research field because it is promising for expanding human capabilities and improving the safety and efficiency of the intricate surgery process.

Current research results have been published in ECCV'24 and the paper is available in my publication webpage [(Link)](https://yangchihyuan.github.io/publications). However, there are some puzzles unsolved yet. For example, why does this method work poorly on some action datasets? How will the quality of text affect the method's performance? If we refine the text description of the NTU RGB+D dataset, what will happen? Is the skeleton data of the NTU RGB+D dataset so noisy that the proposed method works? Given a high-quality skeleton action dataset, will the proposed method still work?
To answer those questions, further research is required to be carried out.
